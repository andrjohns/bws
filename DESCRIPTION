Description: A Bayesian Weighted Sums estimates the summed effect of multiple, often moderately to highly correlated, continuous predictors. Its applications can be found in analysis of exposure mixtures. This is an implementation of the model described by Hamra, Maclehose, Croen, Kauffman, and Newschaffer (2021).
